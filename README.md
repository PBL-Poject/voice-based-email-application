## Overview

Welcome to the **voice-based-email-application** project! This system is designed to make email functionalities accessible to everyone, including visually impaired users. Our approach focuses on user-friendliness for all types of people, ensuring that everyone can easily access and manage their email through voice commands.

## Architecture Diagram

The system consists of the following major components:

- **User**: Initiates and interacts with the system using voice commands.
- **Web Server**: Connects the user with the email system, handles requests, processes data, and communicates with the Gmail database.
- **Text to Speech (TTS)**: Converts text into audio, providing audio feedback to users.
- **Predict Response**: Determines the appropriate response based on the user's input.
- **Intent Classification**: Classifies the userâ€™s intent by analyzing their commands.
- **Speech to Text (STT)**: Converts spoken words into written text, also known as speech recognition.
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies and categorizes key information within the text. This involves detecting named entities and categorizing them.
- **Gmail Database**: Stores user information, used for authentication and verification.
